Simple Story Management
=======================

Simple Tracking of Development Center

STDC is a development project meant for small team development projects but can be applied to larger projects and teams.  It's intended use is a 'simple' development story tracker and does not proscribe any type of development methodology.  It has a simple to use and understand interface and will build in functionality over time.

The Prototype has limited functionality and configurability and can be found at http://ec2-54-245-46-37.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/stdc/ .  

Version 0 is a complete re-write and will be the base for all further development of the tool.

There are many things yet to do as we start development on the first release candidate: 

- determine what kind of build process (ahem: maven) is needed
- stand up a Jenkins server for continuous integration
- stand up a dev server for auto-deployment / manual review
